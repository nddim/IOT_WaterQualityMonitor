# IOT_WaterQualityMonitor

About project

The main aspects of the project include measuring the temperature and water level in the pool, simulating the addition of water via a servo motor, and transmitting and displaying data on a website through Firebase.

The project consists of an ESP32 microcontroller, a DS18B20 sensor for temperature measurement, an HC-SR04 sensor for distance measurement, and a servo motor. The device communicates with the Firebase database, and data is loaded onto a local website via Firebase.

The control panel displays real-time temperature and distance data in a table, and a button to turn the servo motor on and off, simulating the addition of water to the pool. The website communicates with the device through Firebase.
